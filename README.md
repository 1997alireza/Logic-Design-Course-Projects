The project created by Verilog for logic design course in university

## Traffic Light
#####The logic design final project

It's a traffic light for a crossroad with the ability for policeman to control it directly by `A`, `B` and `R` switchs. There is two sensors , `A_Traffic` and `B_Traffic` detects the traffic in the A street and B street and it can stop the counters according to the traffics.
I tested it by `module TestBench` and you can see the [result waveform](). 
I've implemented a [`SR FlipFlop`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)) and a `4-bit counter` with a synchronized reset for this project.
